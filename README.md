# Hate-Speech-Detection-
Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to detect hate speech in text data.

Data Preprocessing: Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLTK and scikit-learn.
Data Exploration and Visualization: Explored and visualized dataset characteristics using pandas and matplotlib to gain insights into data distribution and features.
Model Implementation: Implemented and fine-tuned machine learning algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest) to achieve a classification accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.91 on the test dataset.
Web Application Development: Developed a Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive real-time hate speech detection results.
